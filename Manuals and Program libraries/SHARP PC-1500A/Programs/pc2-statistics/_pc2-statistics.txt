Introduction

Statistics is a general data analysis system to be used with the Radio Shack TRS-80(r) PC-2. The system consists of a Statistics program stored on cassette tape, a special keyboard overlay for your Pocket Computer-2, and this step-by-step instruction manual.

The program is easy to use. Even if you have never used a computer before, the instructions and the keyboard overlay will guide you through each of the program functions. You will find that just a few keystrokes allow you to perform data maintenance functions, calculate a wide variety of statistics on your data, display the analysis results on your PC-2, or list them on your PC-2 printer. The Statistics program and your data remain in the memory of your PC-2 even when the computer is turned off.
