Casio Utilities - Installation

Linux or Mac OS X
=================

Under Linux and Mac OS X you can use the provided Makefile to compile and 
install the utilities:

make
make clean
sudo make install

This will compile the programs and copy them to /usr/local/bin. The Linux and 
osx subdirectories already contain compiled versions so a "sudo make install" 
might be enough.

Three shell scripts are provided to access MD100 floppies directly. Look at the
scripts and modify them to your needs. 

fdutil-5.5 is needed for direct MD100 floppy disk access under Linux.


DOS
===

Copy the programs in the DOS subdirectory somewhere in your path. 

COMP-DOS.BAT compiles everything with Borland C 5.0 (16 bit compiler).
Before comiling, update the BINDIR variable to your needs.


Win32
=====

Copy the programs and libdisk.dll in the win32 subdirectory somewhere
in your path. For more info see win32\readme.txt.

comp-win.cmd compiles everything with Borland C 5.0 (32 bit compiler).
Before comiling, update the BINDIR variable to your needs.


OS/2 or eComStation
===================

Copy the programs in the os2 subdirectory somewhere in your path. 

comp-os2.cmd compiles everything with Borland for OS/2.
Before comiling, update the BINDIR variable to your needs.
