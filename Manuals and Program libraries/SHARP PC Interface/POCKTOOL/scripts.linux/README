SHARP Pocket Computer Tools - Linux scripts
===========================================


1. Introduction
---------------

These scripts provides easy to use command line tools to load and save Basic-programms on SHARP Pocket Computers.

At the moment there are 2 scipts for Linux: One to load a program (cload) and one to save a program from the Pocket Computer (csave).

The whole process of interfacing the Pocket computer and converting files is automated. After the successful configuration of the tool, saving or loading a program from/to the SHARP Pocket Computer is a ONE-STEP process.

The backend of these scripts are the binaries by Torsten MÃ¼cker's PocketTools (http://www.peil-partner.de/ifhe.de/sharp/)

2.1. Saving a program from the SHARP Pocket Computer
----------------------------------------------------

1.  Start the program "csave <filename.bas>" on your PC. The program will wait until it receives an audio signal from the Pocket Computer.
2.  Start CSAVE on your SHARP Pocket Computer.
3.  Conversion to ASCII Basic text will start automatically once transfer from the SHARP has finished.

SYNOPSIS:

	csave [-vh] [-x|k] [-p sharp-model-#] [-c audio-card-#] [-d audio-dev-#] [-m mic-ctrl-name] [-l mic-rec-level] <filename.bas>
	
OPTIONS:

	-h            Print help screen
	-v            Print version information
	-p <number>   Set model number of Sharp (without "PC-")
	-c <number>   Set audio card number (as reported by 'arecord -l')
	-d <number>   Set audio device number (as reported by 'arecord -l')            
	-m <name>     Set control-name of the microphone of the audiointerface (as reported by 'amixer -c <device-#> scontrols')
	-l <number>   Set microphone level (in %) 
	-x            Don't keep interim files (delete temporary generated img and wav file after uploading) 
	-k            Keep all interim files
	
Options can be used to override the configuration file settings.



2.2. Loading a program to the SHARP Pocket Computer
---------------------------------------------------

1.  Start CLOAD on your SHARP Pocket Computer. Alternatively CLOAD can also be started on your SHARP after starting the PC script.
2.  Start the program "cload <filename.bas>" on your PC. 
3.  The program will transfer the BASIC program via it's audio interface and the SHARP cassette interface to the SHARP Pocket Computer.

SYNOPSIS:

	cload [-vh] [-x|k] [-p sharp-model-#] [-c audio-card-#] [-d audio-dev-#] <filename.bas>

OPTIONS:

	-h            Print help screen
	-v            Print version information
	-p <number>   Set model number of Sharp (without "PC-")
	-s            Skip autosensing of CLOAD (start transfer immediately)
	-c <number>   Set audio card number (as reported by 'arecord -l')
	-d <number>   Set audio device number (as reported by 'arecord -l')            
	-x            Don't keep interim files (delete temporary generated img and wav file after uploading) 
	-k            Keep all interim files

Options can be used to override the configuration file settings.



3. Installation
---------------

3.1. Hardware requirements:
---------------------------

To connect the SHARP Pocket Computer with the PC, the SHARP CE-126P, CE-124 or a compatible cassette interface and any ALSA compatible audio interface for the PC is required.  


3.2. Software requirements:
---------------------------

The communication of the SHARP Pocket Computer with the PC is through the PC's audio interface. To record and playback the SHARP's cassette signal, a comprehensive command line tool for audio manipulation is utilized:

SoX - Sound eXchange, the Swiss Army knife of audio manipulation

To install SoX on an Ubuntu based Linux system run:

	sudo apt-get install sox

Another tool needed is "amixer" which comes in the alsa-utils package. Very likely this package is already installed on your Linux distribution. In case it's not, install with:

	sudo apt-get install alsa-utils


3.3. Installing SHARP Pocket Computer Tools + Linux scripts:
------------------------------------------------------------

Change to the directory "scripts.linux" inside the PocketTool installation package and run:

	make
	sudo make install

This compiles the PocketTool binaries, and installs all scripts into the system directories.


3.4. Configuring the Linux scripts:
-----------------------------------

Custom configuration is mandatory for the scripts to work as expected. All configuration is done in "/etc/sharppc.cfg"

Follow the comments inside the configuration file, which will provide you with all information required for a successful configuration.
