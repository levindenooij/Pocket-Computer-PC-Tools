Introduction

The Personal Finance package for the Pocket Computer II is a group of five programs designed to help you manage your money more efficiently. You can use Personal Finance to set up and maintain a budget, keep a checkbook, figure stock portfolio values, or find Interest and annuity yields on your investments.

The five Personal Finance programs are:

BG1 - Budget Management I- Lets you set up amounts to be budgeted in up to 15 different categories.

BG2 - Budget Management II- Lets you keep track of amounts budgeted vs. actual amounts spent for each of your budget categories. You can also print a bar graph of the budgeted amounts and amounts spent, to see where you've been successful or fallen short of your budget goals.

EC - Electronic Checkbook- Keeps track of up to 20 checkbook transactions (deposits or payments) and reconciles your monthly statement.

ST - Value of Stocks- Figures the current value of each stock you own for up to 20 different stocks and the current value of your entire portfolio. You can also print a list of the stocks in your portfolio with their values and the the entire portfolio's value.

IA - Interest and Annuities- Figures yields from your investments with interest or annuities over a given time period, and calculates the required initial investment needed to produce a desired yield over a given time period.
